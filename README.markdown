###SlideshowDemo

This is a demo which displays a finite set of images in a continous slider.
There are 2 activities for a horizontal and a vertical slideshow. This was created mainly to show the credits
of an app I worked on 'MyTaxIndia'. 

####1. VerticalSlideshow
This uses the ScrollView. A timer is used to increment the value of the scrollbar to keep the slider moving.
When the user touches the any of the pictures, the slider stops and zooms in the image for a second before
zooms back to continue to slide.

The same as above but uses the horizontal scrollview.
